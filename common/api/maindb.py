<Purpose>
  This is the API that should be used to interact with the Main Database.
  Functions in this module are the only way that other code should interact
  with the Main Database.
   
  Note: it is yet to be determined how strict the rule of "the only way to
  interact with the Main Database" should be. It is likely that functions
  in this module will return values that will, for example, lazily load
  data from the database. The point is to hide as much of the underlying
  database interaction from other code. It is definitely the case that
  no code outside this module should be modifying the database.
  
  We try to keep all manual transaction management in clearinghouse to within
  this module. The general idea is that the default behavior of django is
  what we want in most places (to commit any time data-altering functions
  are called, such as .save() or .delete()).

    connections haven't been made) or copy the bit of code here that does the

  <Exceptions>

  <Side Effects>
    This function makes it so that we see any transactions commits made by
    other database clients even within a single transaction on the side
    of the script that calls this function.
    This is done by changing the transaction isolation level of InnoDB from the
    default of "repeatable read" to instead be "read committed". For more info, see:

  <Purpose>
    Create a new clearinghouse user in the database. This user will be able to
    login to website, use the clearinghouse xmlrpc api, acquire vessels, etc.
    
    A 'user' lock should be held on the specified username before calling this

    The code calling this function is responsible for first storing the
    corresponding private key of donor_pubkey in the keydb. In the case of the
    website calling this function, the website will make a call to the backend
    to request a new key and that will take care of storing the donor private
