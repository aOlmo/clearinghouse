<Purpose>
  This module defines functions used for rendering error pages. We don't use the
  default error views because we want our 500 error to have access to the
  MEDIA_URL setting and therefore look like the rest of the site.
  
  We don't define a handler for 404 errors because the default one passes a
  RequestContext already, so we don't need to customize it to be able to
  access the MEDIA_URL value in templates. The 404.html file will be used
  by the default 404handler.
